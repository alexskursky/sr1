										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN)Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s town hall on race featured a deep discussion with actor and director David Oyelowo, who revealed he&#8217;s been crying for two weeks over the civil unrest in America, and said he&#8217;s had to have tough conversations about police brutality with his young son.</p>
<p>In &#8220;OWN Spotlight: Where Do We Go From Here,&#8221; the actor, who portrayed the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in &#8220;Selma,&#8221; explains that because he is of Nigerian descent, he has dealt with racism throughout his life.<br />
He admits to mistakes he&#8217;s made, such as thinking racism was a thing of &#8220;the past,&#8221; and advising his son to not get &#8220;confrontational&#8221; with police officers if ever in a situation with them.<br />
Oyelowo said that when he saw that George Floyd wasn&#8217;t resisting arrest while being taken into custody by Minneapolis police, he realized the problem of police brutality is even worse than he believed.<br />
&#8220;I had made the mistake of thinking that things would be different for my son. I say mistake because I had watched things progress in some ways. And then the knee on the neck is so symbolic of so much,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s something I didn&#8217;t realize that I had internalized in a way that makes it difficult for me to function. I didn&#8217;t realize how deep the wounds were. I have spent so much of the last two weeks crying.&#8221;<br />
He continued: &#8220;Those conversations are already emasculating to basically say, forget about justice in an interaction with the police.&#8221;<br />
&#8221; allowfullscreen><br />
Winfrey said she understood, telling viewers that&#8217;s a conversation many black parents have with their children. &#8220;Yeah. And for everybody who&#8217;s watching who is not black, that is the conversation, that is the talk that every black parent has had to have with their children, particularly their sons,&#8221; she said.<br />
Winfrey also spoke with director Ava DuVernay, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Stacey Abrams, along with other leaders and activists.</p>
